## Intro

Live app running at http://supercardgame.herokuapp.com. 

Play an amazing round of Goofspiel (other feature games coming soonâ„¢), where two players battle for the prize and claim victory!

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, clone the rep and then `npm install` all dependencies, create a `.env` file at project root, and fill out your db details (ee `.env.example` for template), afterwards enter `npm run local`.

## Reqs

You will need a MongoDB instance running and connected to the app. Otherwise, this is a standard NodeJS app, for a list of dependencies please see the `package.json` file.
